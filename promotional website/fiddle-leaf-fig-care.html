          The Fiddle Leaf Fig (Ficus lyrata) is one of the most popular indoor plants due to its large, glossy leaves and tropical look. However, this plant can be a bit tricky to care for, requiring the right balance of light, water, and humidity.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-green-700">Light Requirements</h2>
        <p class="text-green-800">
          Fiddle Leaf Figs love bright, indirect light. Direct sunlight can burn their leaves, causing brown spots. Place your Fiddle Leaf Fig near a window where it can receive plenty of filtered light, but avoid harsh direct sun. If the plant doesn’t get enough light, its growth can become leggy, and its leaves may drop.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-green-700">Watering Tips</h2>
        <p class="text-green-800">
          Overwatering is one of the biggest mistakes when caring for a Fiddle Leaf Fig. Water the plant only when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch. Be sure the pot has proper drainage, as stagnant water can lead to root rot. When you water, make sure to soak the soil thoroughly, allowing excess water to drain out.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-green-700">Humidity and Temperature</h2>
        <p class="text-green-800">
          Fiddle Leaf Figs thrive in humid environments and can benefit from occasional misting, especially in dry indoor conditions. If your home is dry, consider using a humidity tray or a humidifier to maintain the right moisture level. Temperature-wise, they prefer warm temperatures between 60-75°F (15-24°C) and should be kept away from drafts, air conditioners, or heat vents.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-green-700">Pruning and Cleaning</h2>
        <p class="text-green-800">
          Pruning your Fiddle Leaf Fig is essential for maintaining its shape and removing damaged or diseased leaves. Use clean, sharp scissors to cut leaves at the base of the stem. Clean the leaves occasionally with a damp cloth to remove dust and allow the plant to breathe. This also helps prevent pests.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-green-700">Repotting Your Fiddle Leaf Fig</h2>
        <p class="text-green-800">
          Repot your Fiddle Leaf Fig every 1-2 years to ensure it has enough space for root growth. Choose a pot that is 1-2 inches larger in diameter than the current one, and ensure the new pot has drainage holes. When repotting, use a well-draining, peat-based potting mix. Avoid placing the plant in too large of a pot, as it may lead to overwatering.
