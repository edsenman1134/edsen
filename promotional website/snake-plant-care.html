        <p class="text-green-800">
          The Snake Plant (Sansevieria), also known as the Mother-in-Law’s Tongue, is one of the most low-maintenance houseplants available. It's perfect for beginners and busy plant owners due to its tolerance to various growing conditions. With upright, stiff leaves, this plant is not only easy to care for but also an excellent air purifier. Here’s everything you need to know to keep your Snake Plant healthy and thriving.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-green-700">Light Requirements</h2>
        <p class="text-green-800">
          Snake Plants are incredibly adaptable when it comes to light. They can thrive in low light conditions, which makes them ideal for rooms that don’t receive a lot of sunlight. However, they also do well in bright, indirect light. Avoid placing them in direct sunlight for extended periods, as this can cause their leaves to burn. If your plant isn't getting enough light, its growth may slow down, and the leaves might start to yellow.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-green-700">Watering Tips</h2>
        <p class="text-green-800">
          One of the main reasons Snake Plants thrive in most homes is their ability to tolerate drought. Overwatering is the most common mistake people make when caring for this plant. Water your Snake Plant only when the soil is completely dry. In the winter months, reduce watering to once every 3-4 weeks. Ensure the pot has proper drainage to prevent root rot, as Snake Plants do not like to sit in soggy soil.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-green-700">Humidity and Temperature</h2>
        <p class="text-green-800">
          Snake Plants prefer dry air, making them perfect for indoor environments with low humidity. While they can tolerate varying temperature ranges, they prefer warmth between 60-85°F (15-29°C). Avoid placing them near drafty windows, air conditioners, or heaters, as rapid temperature changes can stress the plant.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-green-700">Pruning and Cleaning</h2>
        <p class="text-green-800">
          Pruning isn’t necessary for Snake Plants, but you can remove any dead or damaged leaves using a sharp pair of scissors. Be sure to trim from the base of the plant to prevent leaving stubs that may attract pests. Regularly wipe down the leaves with a damp cloth to keep them free from dust and debris. This also helps maintain their air-purifying properties.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-green-700">Repotting Your Snake Plant</h2>
        <p class="text-green-800">
          Snake Plants grow slowly, so they don’t need frequent repotting. However, you should consider repotting every 2-3 years or when the roots outgrow the current pot. Choose a pot that’s 1-2 inches larger than the current one and ensure it has drainage holes. Use a well-draining cactus or succulent mix for repotting.
